We store the outputs from the simulations in ../Output/.

How to run a simulation:

There are in principe two possibilities:

1) Allocate one (or more) nodes with salloc
2) Submit a slurm batch job with sbatch

ZBOX:
1) Allocate with salloc --partition=zbox and run with srun -n cores hydro_lmpi
2) sbatch example-zbox.job (see example-zbox.job in this directory for details)

Important: Always compile with make lmpi and run hydro_lmpi!

Dora:
1) Allocate with salloc (no partition) and run with aprun -n cores hydro_mpi
2) sbatch example-dora.job (see example-dora.job in this directory for details and be sure to change ACCOUNT to uzh8)

Important: Always compile with make mpi and run hydro_mpi!
